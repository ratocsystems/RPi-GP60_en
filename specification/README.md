|:-----|:-----|  
|Product Name|Raspberry Pi I2C Insulated Serial Board|  
|Product model number|RPi-GP60|  
|Interface|GPIO 40 pin: I2C|  
|Serial controller|NXP SC16IS752|  
|Serial port|2 ports (D-Sub 9-pin x 1 port, 10-pin box header x 1 port)<br>*D-Sub 9-pin cable for connecting 10-pin box header is attached|  
|External power supply terminal|2-pin terminal block<br>*Used only when pin 9 of the serial port is set to 5V OUT|  
|RS-232C standard|TIA / EIA-232-F compliant|  
|RS-485/422A standard|TIA/EIA-485-A, TIA/EIA-422-B compliant (half-duplex / full-duplex)<br>* Half-duplex communication supports automatic transmission / reception switching|  
|Serial setting|Can be set by jumper pin on the board|
|Supported baud rates|110, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600,<br>(115200, 230400, 460800, 921600)<br>*Due to I2C speed limit (standard 100kHz), for 115200bps and above, it recommends flow control.<br>*Due to transceiver limitation (650kbps), for RS-232C, up to 460800bps<br>*Due to serial controller limitation, For RS-485 / 422A, up to 921600bps
